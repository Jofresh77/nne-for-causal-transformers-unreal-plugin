# nne-for-causal-transformers-unreal-plugin
 This project showcase an attempt to provide a Unreal Engine 5 plugin using the NNE plugin with a locally running causal transformer model imported as onxx.
 
 *The onnx models are not in this project since they are too large, but any .onnx files can be dragged and dropped into the Unreal Engine Content folder if the NNEOnnxruntime plugin is installed inside a Unreal project.*
